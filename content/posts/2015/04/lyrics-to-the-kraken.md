The Kraken’s a song that captures the essence who we are and why we do this. Written and arranged by Alan Coyne in 2014, it’s a favorite at. Hear it the following ways:

- In [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13fKUoCiaDk) in Berkeley earlier this year (3/1/15) as mermaids, pirates, and other sea creatures
- In [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJjSqegoTrs) in 2013 at the Subterranean Arthouse
- And as a World of Warcraft [machinima music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmBBOEhAwk0), courtesy of Lawless, some time in 2011!

Lyrics below:

I’ll sing ye a song-o, a song of the sea  
And if ye be wise, ye’ll listen t’me  
Tho’ long he’s a-slumbered, ’tis soon he’ll be free  
And the Kraken’ll get ye, me hearty!

With the strength of a whale and the wiles of a fox,  
The Kraken’s a-comin’ t’clean all our clocks  
T’avenge fishsticks, caviar, sushi, and lox  
And the Kraken’ll get ye, me darlin’!

(Yo, ho, ho, ho)

O, the kraken’ll get ye, Jim lad  
He don’t care if ye’re good or ye’re bad  
He’ll shiver yer timbers  
and rip off yer members  
He’ll clinch ye and pinch ye and make ye feel sad

With the skull of a squid and the claws of a crab  
His great eye just stares while his tentacles grab  
Ye can pull off yer peg-leg and give him a stab  
But the Kraken’ll get ye, me hearty!

He’ll hack off yer hook and peel back yer eyepatch  
His beak it’ll bite ye, so batten yer hatch  
Aye, but it’s the third tentacle ye’ll want t’watch  
Or the Kraken’ll get ye, me darlin’!

(Yo, ho, ho, ho)

O, the Kraken’ll get ye, me lass  
He don’t care if ye’re common or class  
He’ll drunk up your rum  
And keel-haul your mum  
He’ll take ye and shake ye and wale on your ass

Now accordin’ t’legend, that slimy brute  
Made Sinbad the Sailor soil his sailor suit  
He’s bolder than Bluebeard, tho’ not so hirsute  
And the Kraken’ll get ye, me hearty

He’s the fiercest beastie in Davy Jones’ locker  
He makes Godzilla look like Betty Crocker  
Yar, they say that Kraken’s one bad mother-  
Shut yo’ mouth!  
Yar, I just be talkin’ ’bout the Kraken  
Then we can dig…  
For treasure, that is!  
YAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR

O the Kraken’ll get ye, ye scum  
He don’t care if ye’re crafty or dumb  
Ye poor scurvy dog  
‘Tis yer stern he’ll flog  
He’ll flail and impale ye until ye go numb

Sooooooooooo:  
Avast now, ye cap’ns, while out on the wave  
Yer vessels all hold the booty he craves  
He’ll suck all yer seamen to watery graves  
Yes, the kraken’ll get ye me hearty

(Row, row, row your boat…)

Yes, the Kraken’ll get ye someday  
He don’t care if ye’re grumpy or gay  
Ye can go eat yer spinach  
But trust me yer finished  
So hoist up yer topsail and anchors aweigh  
The Kraken’ll get ye me hearty!

Weigh hey!
