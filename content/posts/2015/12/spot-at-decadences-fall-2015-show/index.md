Spot went to the circus for DecCadence’s fall show last Sunday, Dec. 6, 2015. We premiered our cover of Vienna Teng’s Hymn of Acxiom, a song about [digital marketing](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/vienna-teng-hymn-of-acxiom,news-17663.html), tracking, and big data. We also ended up licking spiders in our madlib-style StarPhoenixPlumJam. DeCadence’s theme this semester was Harry Potter, so we couldn’t not wave our wands around to Patronus.
