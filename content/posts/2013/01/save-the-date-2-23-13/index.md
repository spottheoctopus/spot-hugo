We’re putting on a concert!

When: Saturday, Feb 23rd, 2013 at 8pm
Where: [Subterranean Arthouse](http://subterraneanarthouse.org/) in Berkeley
2179 Bancroft Way
Berkeley, CA
3 blocks from Downtown Berkeley BART. Here’s a [map](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=2179+Bancroft+Way,+Berkeley,+CA&hl=en&sll=37.269174,-119.306607&sspn=10.676602,22.126465&oq=2179+Bancroft+Way,+Berkeley&hnear=2179+Bancroft+Way,+Berkeley,+California+94704&t=m&z=16).

More info coming soon =) Otherwise, we’re still rehearsing every week and [recording ourselves](http://youtube.com/spottheoctopus) intermittently. We had an epic music party on NYE to bring in 2013 with lots of instruments, which is not something that usually happens when we meet, being an a cappella group and all.

Edited to add: see our beautiful [concert poster](posts/2013/02/undulating-a-cappella/)!
